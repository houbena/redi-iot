# Internet of Things in Action - Workbook

The first draft of this document is created based on this course overview.

## Introduction

This document contains the exercises of the labs offered within the course “Internet of Things in Action” by ReDi school (Check the schedule here). In this document, we try to provide step by step instructions for the labs to lead the attendees to a better understanding of the content.
This is a workbook that includes only information about the labs, thus course session that do not include hands-on exercises are skipped in the section of exercises.

## Requirements

Instructions in this workbook should be clear and precise.
Considering that the attendees should be able to learn from this document after the course, amongst others as an auxiliary mean for their final project, the instructions should be self explanatory and reproducible within a defined environment. However, this document is not meant to be a replacement for the attendance of the workshops.
Considering the different language skills of the attendees (many of them don’t use English on a daily basis), this document should be maintained in simple English.
